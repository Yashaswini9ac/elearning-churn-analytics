📌 A real-world churn & revenue analysis project for a subscription-based e-learning platform.  
This project identifies high-risk churn segments and quantifies revenue loss using Tableau.

## 🎯 Business Goal

To understand:
- How bad churn is overall  
- Which **customer segments** churn the most (Corporate vs Individual)  
- Which **regions** are most at risk  
- What the **revenue impact** of churn is  
- Where to focus retention efforts first

---

## 📊 Key Insights (From the Dashboard)

- **Individual users churn ~3x more than Corporate users**
- The **USA Individual segment** has both **high churn + high revenue**
- Reducing churn of this segment by just **5%** could retain **~500 customers**, generating approx. **$150,000/year**
- Targeting this segment first gives **maximum financial impact**
